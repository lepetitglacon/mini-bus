Creating a mini Metro-style game focused on buses with **JavaScript**, **Leaflet**, **Turf.js**, and **GeoJSON** is a fantastic idea! Here's a guide to help you get started on building a simplified bus management game with a city map, bus routes, and basic passenger simulation.

---

### **Project Overview**

In this game, players will manage bus routes by drawing and modifying routes on a map. The goal is to transport passengers efficiently between stops, ensuring minimal congestion and high satisfaction.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up the Map**

Use **Leaflet** to display a 2D map of the city, with **GeoJSON** for route and stop data.

1. **Initialize the Map**:
    - Use Leaflet to set up a basic map centered on your city (or a custom game area).
    - Set up tiles using providers like OpenStreetMap.

   ```javascript
   const map = L.map('map').setView([latitude, longitude], zoomLevel);
   L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
     attribution: '&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
   }).addTo(map);
   ```

2. **Load City Data**:
    - Use GeoJSON for city roads and bus stops. Import the data to render roads and landmarks that players can use for route planning.

   ```javascript
   // Load GeoJSON data for city roads and bus stops
   L.geoJSON(cityGeoJSONData).addTo(map);
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Draw and Manage Bus Routes**

Let players draw and edit routes on the map with **Leaflet**'s drawing tools, storing route information in **GeoJSON** format.

1. **Add Route Drawing Controls**:
    - Allow players to draw lines representing bus routes, which they can modify to optimize traffic flow.
    - Use **Leaflet Draw** or custom controls for drawing polylines.

   ```javascript
   const drawnRoutes = new L.FeatureGroup().addTo(map);

   const drawControl = new L.Control.Draw({
     edit: { featureGroup: drawnRoutes },
     draw: { polyline: true, marker: false, polygon: false, circle: false }
   });
   map.addControl(drawControl);

   // Capture the drawn route as a GeoJSON line
   map.on(L.Draw.Event.CREATED, (event) => {
     const layer = event.layer;
     drawnRoutes.addLayer(layer);
     const geojsonRoute = layer.toGeoJSON();
     saveRoute(geojsonRoute); // Function to save or handle the route
   });
   ```

2. **Route Data Structure**:
    - Store each route as a GeoJSON LineString, with coordinates and optional properties (e.g., route name, bus frequency).

---

### **Step 3: Implement Bus Simulation Logic**

Use **Turf.js** to help with spatial calculations, such as distance and point projection, which can simulate bus movement along routes.

1. **Create a Bus Object**:
    - Each bus object contains route data, current position, and speed.

   ```javascript
   const bus = {
     route: geojsonRoute, // Route GeoJSON
     positionIndex: 0, // Index of the current position in route coordinates
     speed: 0.001 // Adjust for realistic speed
   };
   ```

2. **Move the Bus Along the Route**:
    - Use **Turf.js** to calculate positions along the route for realistic bus movement.
    - Advance the bus position by incrementing along the coordinates of the route LineString.

   ```javascript
   function moveBus(bus) {
     const routeCoords = bus.route.geometry.coordinates;
     if (bus.positionIndex < routeCoords.length - 1) {
       bus.positionIndex += bus.speed;
       const nextPosition = routeCoords[Math.floor(bus.positionIndex)];
       bus.marker.setLatLng([nextPosition[1], nextPosition[0]]);
     } else {
       bus.positionIndex = 0; // Loop back to the start or handle route end
     }
   }
   ```

    - Use `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval` to continuously update the bus’s position.

---

### **Step 4: Implement Passenger Logic**

To simulate passengers, define stops and assign passengers based on proximity to bus stops.

1. **Generate Passengers at Bus Stops**:
    - Each bus stop generates a set number of passengers over time. Store passengers in an array with a destination stop.

   ```javascript
   const stops = [
     { id: 1, coordinates: [lng, lat], passengers: [] },
     // Other stops
   ];

   function generatePassengers(stop) {
     const destinationStop = chooseRandomStop(); // Define your own logic for this
     stop.passengers.push({ destination: destinationStop });
   }
   ```

2. **Passenger Boarding and Alighting**:
    - When a bus arrives at a stop, passengers with matching destinations board the bus. Implement this by comparing the bus’s current position to the stop’s coordinates.

   ```javascript
   function managePassengers(bus, stop) {
     bus.passengers = bus.passengers.filter(
       (passenger) => passenger.destination !== stop.id
     );

     stop.passengers.forEach((passenger) => {
       if (bus.passengers.length < bus.capacity) bus.passengers.push(passenger);
     });

     stop.passengers = stop.passengers.filter(
       (passenger) => passenger.destination !== stop.id
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Visual Feedback**:
    - Show passenger count on the bus marker and display satisfaction if the bus is timely or overcrowded.

---

### **Step 5: Score System and Objectives**

Define winning conditions and challenges to make the game engaging:

1. **Scoring**:
    - Score based on factors like average wait time, route efficiency, and passenger satisfaction.
    - Display scores in real-time, updating as passengers reach their destinations.

2. **Objectives**:
    - Set goals such as moving a specific number of passengers within a time limit or managing routes with limited resources.
    - Add random events, like route disruptions, that require the player to adjust routes or handle delays.

---

### **Step 6: User Interface and Controls**

Add controls to manage the game and display information to the player:

1. **Route Management UI**:
    - Show buttons to add, edit, or delete routes and display information about each route.

2. **Bus and Passenger Indicators**:
    - Use tooltips or info pop-ups on buses and stops to display passenger counts, wait times, or satisfaction.

---

### **Bonus: Refinements and Enhancements**

To make the game even more polished, consider these optional features:

- **Difficulty Levels**: Add increasing levels of difficulty with more passengers, complex routes, or budget constraints.
- **Real-Time Traffic Simulation**: Incorporate a basic traffic simulation to slow buses on busy routes.
- **Sound and Visual Effects**: Use animations and sounds for actions like boarding, stopping, or reaching a destination to make the game more immersive.
